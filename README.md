# Lab 3
###### By: Jacob Huebner - ITMD 362 Spring 2019 

For this lab, you will implement Form Styling and Web Fonts

## Requirements

1. [x] For this Lab, build off the existing CSS, including its baseline grid and typographic (modular) scale.

* Design a mobile-scale form that uses only shades of gray (no solid borders) for the input regions. 
* Favor an open design with plenty of padding and white space.

2. [x] Then, set up the `font-family` with a robust font stack (3 fonts deep) made up of commonly available system fonts. You might 
use a site like https://fonts.google.com to get yourself started.

3. [x] Finally, post a link to your Github repository, live link, and html/css validation for this lab to your Basecamp file.
